## The new ERA for Trading Cryptos Algorithmically

By leveraging the apis of binance, Ive built some cool features on top of it. [List of binance api's here](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#change-log).


# How it works  
Sooooooo, there is a set of rules or guidelines and actions that can be associated with a symbol(Coin to be simple), in order to execute one or more associated actions, the rules associated with the coin must be successfully undergone.  
<br/>
The rules and actions will be pre-defined with its own set of keys for each and can be associated with the coins in any fashion.  
**Also...**
You can algorithmize your trading pattern ,so that i can give you as a rule, I've integrated a specialized logger, it will log all the steps taken from your rule.
by this we can calculate the efficiency of the rule and there by increasing the returns out of it  
<br/>
<br/>
